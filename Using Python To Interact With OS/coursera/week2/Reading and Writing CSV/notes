If we have data in a format we understand, then we have what we need to parse the information from the file. What does parsing really mean?
Using rules to understand a file or datastream as structured data.

Parsing a file means analyzing its content to correctly structure the data. We use a bunch of different file formats to structure, store, and transport data. You might be familiar with some already. For example, HTML is a markup format which defines the content of a webpage. JSON is a data interchange format commonly used to pass data between computers on networks, especially the internet. CSV or comma separated values is a very common data format used to store data as segment of text separated by commas.
